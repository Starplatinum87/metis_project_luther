Project focused on creating a linear regression model to predict return on investment on film budget by the end of a film's box office run using data from IMDb and IMDbPro. The data gathered will focus on revenue numbers and proportions of budget returned by the end of the box office run and details related to the film's popularity, such as MOVIEmeter rating, user ratings and articles written.
